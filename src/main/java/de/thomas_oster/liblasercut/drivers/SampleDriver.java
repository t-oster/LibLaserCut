/**
 * This class should act as a starting-point, when implementing a new Lasercutter driver.
 * It will take a Laserjob and just output the Vecor-Parts as G-Code.
 * 
 * The file contains comments prefixed with "#<step>" which should guide you in the process
 * of creating custom drivers. Also read the information in the Wiki on
 * https://github.com/t-oster/VisiCut/wiki/
 * 
 * #1: Create a new JavaClass, which extends the de.thomas_oster.liblasercut.drivers.LaserCutter class
 * #2: Implement all abstract methods. Each of them is explained in this example.
 * #3: In Order to see your driver in VisiCut, add your class to the getSupportedDrivers() method
 * in the de.thomas_oster.liblasercut.LibInfo class (src/de/thomas_oster/liblasercut/LibInfo.java)

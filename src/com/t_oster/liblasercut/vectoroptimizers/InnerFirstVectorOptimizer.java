     * cut inside parts first, outside parts later
     * this algorithm is very robust, it works even for unconnected paths that
     * are split into individual lines (e.g. from some DXF imports)
     * it is not completely perfect, as it only considers the bounding-box and
     * not the individual path
     *
     * HEURISTIC:
     * this algorithm is based on the following observation:
     * let I and O be rectangles, I inside O
     * for explanations, assume that:
     * - the X-axis goes from left to right
     * - the Y-axis goes from bottom to top
     *
     *         ---------------- O: outside rectangle
     *         |              |
     *         |    ----      |
     * y axis  |    |in| I    |
     * ^       |    ----      |
     * |       |              |
     * |       ----------------
     * |
     * ------> x axis
     *
     * look at each border:
     *  right border: I.getXMax() < O.getXMax()
     *   left border: I.getXMin() > O.getXMin()
     *    top border: I.getYMax() < O.getYMax()
     * bottom border: I.getYMin() > O.getYMin()
     *
     * If we now SORT BY ymax ASCENDING, ymin DESCENDING, xmax ASCENDING, xmin DESCENDING
     *           (higher sorting priority listed first)
     * we get the rectangles sorted inside-out:
     * 1. I
     * 2. O
     *
     * Because we sort by four values, this still works if
     * the two rectangles start at the same corner and have the same width,
     * but only differ in height.
     *
     * If each rectangle is split into four separate lines
     * (e.g. because of a bad DXF import),
     * this still mostly works:
     * 1. O: bottom line
     * 2. I: bottom
     * 3. I: top, left, right (both have same YMax, but top has a higher YMin)
     * 4: O: top, left, right (both have same YMax, but top has a higher YMin)
     *
     * TRADEOFFS AND LIMITATIONS:
     * This algorithm does not work for paths that have the same bounding-box
     * (e.g. a circle inscribed to a square)
     *
     * For concave polygons with the same bounding-box,
     * many simple Polygon-inside-Polygon algorithms also fail
     * (or have a useless definition of "inside" that matches the misbehaviour):
     * Draw a concave polygon, remove one point at a concave edge.
     * The resulting polygon is clearly outside the original, although every
     * edge of it is inside the original!
     *
     * FUTURE WORK:
     * It would also be nice to sort intersecting polygons, where one polygon
     * is "90% inside" and "10% outside" the other.
     * Real-world example:_A circular hole at the border of a rectangle.
     * Due to rounding errors, it may appear slightly outside the rectangle.
     * Mathematically, it is neither fully inside nor fully outside, but the
     * user clearly wants it to be counted as "inside".
